## About square_pack.js
The square_pack is an algorithm, that calculates the longest possible
side (S) of any number (N) squares, in a given rectangle (W x H) and
returns the number of columns (C) and rows (R). I translated Markus
phyton code to JavaScript and set up a basic example, drawing the results
to an html5 <canvas>. I'm using the P5 JavaScript library (http://p5.js.org)
to render this animation.
